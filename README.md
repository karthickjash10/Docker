# Docker

Docker is a tool that helps run projects as a standalone application.

The uploaded project is converted into a JAR file, which runs locally on any machine. This JAR file is found in the target directory.
This file is converted into a docker image, which is to be stored as Docker container. These containers helps the project run in almost very machines.
